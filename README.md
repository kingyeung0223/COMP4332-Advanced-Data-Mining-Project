# COMP4332-Advanced-Data-Mining-Project
The group project for COMP4332 Advanced Data Mining. The goal of this project is to predict the waiting list size of a course at a specific time by using different kinds of neural network.

In short, data about waitlist size are crawled with scrapy and stored in a mongoDB. 
Data are then extracted from MongoDB for training the neural network by using Keras.
